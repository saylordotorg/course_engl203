**Unit 3: Romanticism** <span id="3"></span> 
*Like authors of the sentimental novel, Romantic poets and authors built
on and moved beyond the Enlightenment’s emphasis on rational inquiry and
critique by emphasizing the intuitive and the emotional. Romanticism
emerged in late 18<sup>th</sup>-century England as well as France and
Germany. Over the past century and a half, literary historians have
offered various accounts of why Romanticism emerged during this period,
what similarities join different strains of Romanticism together and how
to understand the distinct differences - political as well as
aesthetic - among Romantics. One of the most lasting and influential
definitions that joins various Romantics together comes from the
mid-20<sup>th</sup> century literary critic René Wellek: “imagination
for the view of poetry, nature for the view of the world, and symbol and
myth for poetic style.” From this perspective, what the Romantics share
is an emphasis on the creative power of the individual imagination and a
reliance on nature as a guide for philosophical, social, and literary
truths as opposed to a neoclassical emphasis on tradition.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will build on these ideas in an attempt to define the
movement in terms of themes, styles, and tropes. We will also examine
various social and economic contexts that fostered Romanticism. Some of
the keys authors we will investigate include the most canonical poets of
the era - William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe
Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Keats - as well as important women authors
such as Anna Letitia Barbauld, Felicia Hemans, and Mary Shelley.*

     Instructions: Read Book 9 and Book 10 of Wordsworth’s The Prelude,
    where he narrates his excitement and support and then disappointment
    in the French Revolution. The French Revolution would become central
    to the lives and worldviews of most of the British romantics. Where
    the older Wordsworth ardently supported the cause in his youth, he
    became increasingly conservative as he grew older and renounced his
    earlier hopes of revolutionary change. Conversely, the younger Percy
    Shelley and Lord Byron would see their turn away as apostasy and
    would continue to envision the French Revolution, despite its
    problems, as epitomizing the possibility of radical political and
    social change.

     Instructions: Read this essay for an overview of Romanticism as a
    reaction to the Industrial Revolution. *Romanticism* is often seen
    as a reaction against industrialization in the form of a retreat
    into nature or a summoning up of nature as an antidote to
    industrialization and rationalization. While Romanticism’s
    relationship with the emerging industrial order is more complex -
    for example, its emphasis on the individual and his or her feelings
    can be read as parallel to a modern capitalist and consumerist focus
    on individual satisfaction and accomplishment - The Romantics, on
    the whole, offered some of the most trenchant commentaries of the
    cost of industrial growth.   
      
     Reading this essay should take approximately 15 minutes.

     *Lyrical Ballads* contains poems by William Wordsworth and Samuel
    T. Coleridge. Using everyday language and representing humble and
    rustic life, the poems were a radical departure from canonical
    poetry at the time, which tended to be more formal and elevated in
    tone and subject. Wordsworth’s preface is one of a number of
    important re-definitions of poetry offered by the major Romantic
    poets. In particular, the preface breaks from neoclassical
    conventions by emphasizing the origins of poetry in emotion and by
    calling for the eschewal of heightened poetic diction in favor of
    everyday language.     
      
     Studying the preface and these poems should take approximately 2

**3.2.3 The Poet as Unacknowledged Legislator: Shelley’s “Defence of
Poetry”** <span id="3.2.3"></span>

    Shelley”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ENGL404-Percy-Bysshe-Shelley-Saylor.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this essay to learn about Percy Bysshe Shelley’s
    life and works. One of the most famous of the second generation of
    British Romantic poets, Shelley, like his good friend Byron, fled
    the repressive climate of Britain for continental Europe in the
    1810s due to personal and political reasons. Unlike Coleridge and
    Wordsworth, who turned increasingly conservative, Shelley continued
    to espouse radical philosophy, poetics, and politics until his early
    death.   
      
     Reading this essay should take approximately 15 minutes.

    Poetry”](http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/mod/shelley-poetry.asp) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: After reading the introduction to Shelley, please
    read his most famous statement on poetry in his essay, “A Defence of
    Poetry.” In this piece, Shelley - like Coleridge and Wordsworth -
    celebrates the creative power of the poet, linking that power to
    nature and to the poet’s connection with a transcendent wisdom or
    spirit. At the same time, in concluding, he emphasizes the poet’s
    connection to his or her social context, the fact that poets
    manifest “less their spirit than the spirit of the age,” and to the
    poet’s role in fomenting political and social change: “Poets are the
    unacknowledged legislators of the world.” Critics have spent much
    time debating exactly how to read Shelley’s statements here, and his
    most famous poems on politics, poetic inspiration, and historical
    transformation can offer some further glimpses into his thinking.   
      
     Reading this essay should take approximately 1 hour.

    when it seemed on the brink of revolution, a revolution Shelley both
    yearned for and feared. In “Mont Blanc” and “Ode to the West Wind,”
    Shelley further expounds on the poet’s relationship to nature and

**3.4.3 Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein*** <span id="3.4.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein***
    Link: Mary Shelley’s
    *[Frankenstein](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/84) *(HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read Mary Shelley’s famous novel. Written when
    Shelley was only 18 years old, *Frankenstein* has become one of the
    most famous texts to emerge from British Romanticism. Shelley
    composed the work as part of a story-telling contest with Percy
    Shelley (her lover and future husband), Lord Byron, and John
    Polidori. The novel has been read as a covert statement on women’s
    position in early 19<sup>th</sup>-century society, as a critique of
    romantic naturalism and romantic overreaching, as a reflection on
    the failed promises of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution,
    among many other things. *Frankenstein* is best known for its
    engagement with the radical science of the era.  
      
     Reading this novel should take approximately 9 hours.  
      
     Terms of Use: *Frankenstein* is in the public domain.

**3.4.4 Defining Romanticism, Part 2** <span id="3.4.4"></span> 
-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Defining Romanticism, Part 2”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Defining Romanticism, Part
    2”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ENGL203-Unit-3-Guide-to-Responding-to-Defining-Romanticism-Part-2-FINAL1.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Now that you have completed your exploration of
    romanticism, you should return to the definition you crafted in
    response to the first activity in Subunit 3.1.1, “Defining
    Romanticism, Part 1.” Using that definition as your starting point,
    construct a two to three paragraph expansion of your definition, now
    supplying specific examples to illustrate each of your main points /
    characteristics. You could also supply possible complicating
    examples, showing how some of the works we have read trouble or
    contradict the definition you originally produced. For instance, if
    you originally defined romanticism as embracing nature as innocent
    and as a source of comfort and truth, then you might now allude to
    Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey” as exemplifying such a view or point to
    Blake’s “The Tiger” as revealing nature as terrifying as much as
    comforting.   
        
     Once you have completed this activity, or if you need assistance,
    check The Saylor Foundation’s [“Guide to Responding to Defining
    Romanticism, Part
    2.”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ENGL203-Unit-3-Guide-to-Responding-to-Defining-Romanticism-Part-2-FINAL1.pdf)  
        
     Completing this activity should take approximately 1 hour.
