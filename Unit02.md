**Unit 2: The Rise of the Modern Novel** <span id="2"></span> 
*While clearly not a literary period, the rise of the novel, as we know
it, took place over the course of the 18<sup>th </sup>century. Though
prose fiction had existed since ancient times, the modern novel - a
serious form with mass, popular appeal - was born at some point in the
early 1700s. In this unit, we will trace the emergence and maturation of
the novel, seeking to understand the reasons for its popularity while
exploring and defining a number of its features and sub-genres.*

**2.1.3 Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe: Religion, Economics, and Genre**

-   **Reading: Daniel Defoe’s *Robinson Crusoe***
    Link: Daniel Defoe’s [*Robinson
    Crusoe*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/521)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapters 1 - 3, 6, 11, and 14 of Defoe’s
    *Robinson Crusoe.*  
      
     *Robinson Crusoe* has frequently been seen as the first fully
    realized English novel due to its combination of realistic
    description of the physical world and dialogue with close attention
    to the psychological turmoil and development of a character taken
    from everyday life. In doing so, it combines elements of the
    Protestant spiritual autobiography with the adventurous elements of
    the prose romance and the episodic travels of the picaresque. Like
    *Oroonoko*, it takes its setting from the expansion of the British
    empire and British economic interests during the period, but unlike
    *Oroonoko*, it focuses on an Englishman as he attempts to maintain
    and reformulate his national, religious, and economic identity on a
    deserted island off the coast of South America.

    *Theory of Moral Sentiments.* While best known for his economic

     Smith provided one of the most important and influential accounts
    of moral sense philosophy of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Moral
    sense philosophy argued that humans are endowed with an innate moral
    sense. Smith built on this work in considering how and why we
    sympathize with others. Many literary and intellectual historians
    have seen this philosophical emphasis on sympathy and moral feelings
    as deeply connected to the contemporaneous rise of the sentimental
    novel, as epitomized by the work of Samuel Richardson; see Subunit
    2.2.2.
