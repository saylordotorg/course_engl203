Scholars tend to label the period between the Renaissance and the modern
era as the long 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries, meaning
that they span from around 1680 - 1830 and 1775 - 1910, respectively,
and that so many literary movements and cultural changes took place
during these interim years that a narrower title is difficult to come
by. In this course, we will examine these formative cultural and
literary developments chronologically, dividing the course into four
roughly sequential periods: The Enlightenment and Restoration
Literature; The Rise of the Novel; Romanticism; and the Victorian
Period. We will identify and contextualize the principal characteristics
of each of these movements/periods, reading representative texts and
examining their relationship to those texts that preceded or were
contemporaneous with them. As such, this course foregrounds the
movement, the changes, and the continuities from the neoclassicism of
authors such as John Dryden and Alexander Pope through the emergence of
the novel in the writings of Aphra Behn, Daniel Defoe, and Samuel
Richardson to the Romanticism of William Blake, William Wordsworth, and
John Keats to the Victorian era developments of prose and poetry by
writers such as Alfred Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Elizabeth Barrett
Browning. At the same time, the course places these literary
developments alongside the transformation of the English nation. Over
the course of this period, the modern United Kingdom emerged. From a
monarchical government, it shifted to a parliamentary democracy, as its
borders expanded formally to include Scotland and as its empire grew to
its height at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. At the same time,
the British Isles were the site of unprecedented social and economic
upheaval through processes of industrialization and urbanization.
Intellectually and philosophically, this era saw the emergence of modern
science and the displacement, to a large extent, of Christianity and
tradition as the foundations of truth. In a variety of ways, writers
responded to and helped to spur and foster these changes that define
modernity, and in the process of doing so, they helped to create
literature as a new discipline distinct from yet parallel to religious,
philosophical, and scientific pursuits.
