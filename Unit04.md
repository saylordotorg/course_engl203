**Unit 4: The Victorian Period** <span id="4"></span> 
*We will begin by tracing the chronological arc of the Victorian
Period - from early socio-economic unrest to the height of the British
Empire and on to the erosion of Victorian values at the end of the
century. We will then turn to literature from the period, situating
major texts within the dynamic range of attitudes that accompanied the
period’s historical developments, while attempting to define some of the
period’s principal characteristics. In reading authors such as Charles
Dickens, Charlotte* *Brontë*, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Alfred
Lord Tennyson, we will explore the socio-economic transformations
brought about by the rise of industrial capitalism, shifting ideas about
gender, the influence of Britain’s expanding empire, and the formal
innovations and challenges these and other authors produced in
responding to their age.**
