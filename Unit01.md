**Unit 1: The Enlightenment and Restoration Literature** <span
id="1"></span> 
*With the Restoration of the crown in 1660, a new era in English
literature and politics began. While the Glorious Revolution of 1688 -
1689 firmly established Parliament’s superiority over the monarchy,
writers responded to the end of Puritan rule by addressing previously
proscribed materials - especially sexuality - often in increasingly
secular terms. At the same time, the philosophical and scientific
foundation of the Enlightenment­ - most notably the chartering of the
Royal Society in 1662 and the writings of John Locke at the end of the
century - appeared. During the century that followed, Enlightenment
thinkers like Voltaire believed that one could use reason and rational
thought to combat the forces of ignorance, tyranny, and repression that
had come to be associated with the church and the absolutist monarchic
government.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will study the development of neoclassical
aesthetics and the renewal of the theater in the Restoration period
before exploring the development of Enlightenment philosophy and its
relationship to key literary developments of the first half of the
18<sup>th</sup> century from political satire to Alexander Pope’s famous
mock-epic,* The Rape of the Lock*.*

    Mirabilis*](http://www.luminarium.org/eightlit/dryden/londonreborn.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read the excerpts from Dryden’s *Annus Mirabilis.*
    Dryden was named poet laureate in 1668, and by post accounts, he was
    seen as the most important English poet and critic of the late
    17<sup>th</sup> century. His various critical writingshelped to
    establish an English version of neoclassical poetics, a poetics on
    display in his poetry, as the leading theory of the age.  
      
     In the selection from *Annus Mirabilis*, Dryden celebrates the
    rebuilding of London after the great fire of 1666, forecasting its
    renewal and future greatness. Pay attention to the poem’s thematic
    content - e.g., its references to trade and empire in its vision of
    London’s future; its form; its highly regular rhythm and rhyme; its
    controlled and classical allusions; and its figurative language.

     Instructions: Read Dryden’s poems, “Mac Flecknoe” and “Alexander’s
    Feast.” In “Mac Flecknoe,” Dryden produces one of the most famous
    mock-heroic satires of the era. As with other mock-heroic pieces,
    Dryden uses the heightened language of an epic to satirize his
    target, the poet Thomas Shadwell. “Alexander’s Feast” takes an
    episode from Alexander the Great’s history to meditate upon the
    power of music to move people’s emotions.      
      
     Studying these poems should take approximately 1 hour and 30

     Instructions: Read *The Way of the World* for an example of
    18<sup>th</sup> century Restoration comedy. William Congreve’s witty
    comedy-of-manners play features a startlingly complex plot and

    of love, power, and money. Pay attention to its frank depiction of
    sexuality and its emphasis on the power dynamics of social life.

    Immanuel Kant’s [“What Is
    Enlightenment?”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/What-is-Enlightenment.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Kant’s “What Is Enlightenment?” This piece comes
    from the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Kant provides one of
    the most famous definitions of Enlightenment.  
      
     Kant’s essay offers a counter-intuitive account of individual
    reason and its public use in terms of religious beliefs, defining
    public use in terms we might more readily see as private - the “use
    which a person makes of it as a scholar” - as opposed to its private
    use - “in a particular civil post or office” - which, according to
    Kant, may be restricted.  
      
     Public reason, on the other hand, should be allowed full freedom,
    especially the realm of religion. This faith in reason culminates in
    Kant’s answer that the present is not an enlightened age, but it is
    an age of enlightenment, as many of the restrictions and limitations
    on the use of reason have been removed so that humankind may move
    beyond its “self-imposed tutelage.”

     Instructions: Read these excerpts from Condorcet’s *The Future
    Progress of the Human Mind*. This piece comes from the end of the
    18<sup>th</sup> century. Condorcet offers a model of Enlightenment
    optimism’s faith in the human capacity to continue to approach
    perfection through the use of reason. Condorcet carries this faith
    in reason even further, prophesying the ever-increasing capacity of
    humankind to understand and dominate the world around him,
    epitomizing the Enlightenment as a whole.

     Instructions: Read the selections from Locke’s *An Essay Concerning
    Human Understanding*,and then read Chapters 1 - 3 of Locke’s *Second
    Treatise of Government.* When reading these excerpts from Locke,
    keep in mind Brians’s overview as well as the information on the
    Enlightenment from Subunit 1.2.1.  
      
     In Locke’s *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*, he offers one
    of the most famous accounts of his empiricist epistemology: the idea
    that all knowledge derives from experience, the starting position
    for much Enlightenment thought. In particular, he describes the mind
    as a tabula rasa, as a blank slate, upon which experience inscribes
    itself, creating knowledge. This emphasis on the experiential nature
    of knowledge served to reinforce developing defenses of scientific
    knowledge and to provide a foundation for the Enlightenment’s
    project of questioning all pre-established claims to knowledge. At
    the same time, this emphasis on the individual’s sensual experience
    of the world as the basis of knowledge came to frame critiques of
    the Enlightenment project from within and without, including
    Romanticism’s subjectivism.  
      
     In *Second Treatise* (1689), John Locke articulates his theories of
    natural law and natural right, arguing that government is natural
    and necessary, as long as it maintains popular consent. Locke’s
    ideas have been seen as defending the Glorious Revolution and as
    providing the theoretical groundwork for the revolutions of the late
    18<sup>th</sup> century with their emphasis on individual liberty
    and on government deriving its powers from the people.    
      
     Reading these selections should take approximately 1 hour.  
      
     Terms of Use: Locke’s *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* and

    the Lock*  
     [ePub and Kindle](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2428) - *Essay on
    Man*  
      
     Instructions: Read the *Rape of the Lock*. Read the first two
    epistles of Pope’s “Essay on Man” and Part 1 of his “Essay on
    Criticism.”    
      
     Alexander Pope was generally considered the greatest English poet
    of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and he achieved great fame and
    influence (and was the target of much criticism) during his
    lifetime. He was best known for his neoclassical verse, his
    extensive use of the *heroic couplet* - two rhymed lines of iambic
    pentameter - his satiric wit, and his poetic essays, which espouse
    both neoclassical theory and Enlightenment ideals.  
      
     In his famous mock-epic, *The Rape of the Lock*, Alexander Pope
    satirizes a frivolous quarrel between two wealthy families, poking
    fun but also astounding readers with his metrical finesse and
    creativity. In his “Essay on Criticism,” for example, he puts
    forward the neoclassical idea that the rules of art discovered by
    classical writers are true, for they are true to nature: “Those
    rules of old discover’d, not devis’d,/ Are Nature still, but Nature
    methodis’d; / Nature, like liberty, is but restrain’d / By the same
    laws which first herself ordain’d.” Poetry should be true to nature,
    of course, but the great poets of the past have already “discover’d,
    not devis’d” laws in keeping with nature, laws they have
    “methodis’d” so that we can better follow nature. At the beginning
    of the second epistle of his “Essay on Man,” Pope offers one of the
    quintessential statements of the Enlightenment’s focus on this world
    and on discovering and manipulating the way it works: “Know, then,
    thyself, presume God not to scan;/ The proper study of mankind is
    man.” Instead of focusing on metaphysical questions or emphasizing
    humankind’s relationship to God, Pope contends that it is mankind’s
    place to study oneself and the world we inhabit. The 18<sup>th</sup>
    century would come to be characterized as the Enlightenment for this
    very emphasis of the use of reason to dispel previously accepted
    ideas and problems based in religion and tradition.  
      
     Reading these excerpts from Pope’s works should take approximately
    2 hours.
